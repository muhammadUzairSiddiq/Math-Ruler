# 🎮 Your Custom Setup Guide

## ✅ **Your Current Setup**
I can see you already have:
- ✅ **UI Canvas** with proper structure
- ✅ **Result Panel** with "Correct Result" and "wrong Result" images
- ✅ **PlayerController** already configured
- ✅ **Number sprites** and text elements
- ✅ **Equation text** element already exists
- ✅ **Submit Button** (you'll add this manually)

## 🚀 **Quick Setup for Your Existing UI**

### **Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)**
1. **Create a GameObject** in your Unity scene
2. **Name it** "CustomSetup"
3. **Add the `CustomSetup` script** to it
4. **Add a Submit Button** to your UI (if you haven't already)
5. **Play the scene** - it will automatically:
   - Find your existing UI elements
   - Connect everything together

### **Option 2: Manual Setup**
1. **Create GameObject** named "CustomSetup"
2. **Add `CustomSetup` script** to it
3. **Right-click** the component in Inspector
4. **Select "Setup with Existing UI"** from context menu

## 📋 **What Gets Created/Connected**

### **🎯 Elements Used/Created:**
- **Equation Text** (uses your existing "equation text" or creates new one)
- **Submit Button** (finds your existing button or prompts you to add one)

### **🔗 Your Existing Elements Used:**
- **Result Panel** (your existing panel)
- **Correct Result** (your existing correct image)
- **wrong Result** (your existing wrong image)

### **🎮 GameObjects Created:**
- **GameManager** (with AnswerVerifier script)
- **UIManager** (with UIManager script)
- **InputHandler** (with InputHandler script)

## 🎯 **How It Works with Your UI**

### **1. Equation Display**
- Shows at top: `7 + 8 = 15` (where 15 is your current position)
- Updates as you move character

### **2. Submit Answer**
- Click **Submit Button** or press **Space/Enter**
- System checks if your position matches correct answer

### **3. Result Display**
- **Correct Answer**: Shows your "Correct Result" image
- **Wrong Answer**: Shows your "wrong Result" image
- Both use your existing result panel

### **4. Game Flow**
- **Correct** → New equation generated
- **Wrong** → Same equation, try again

## 🛠 **Manual Configuration (If Needed)**

If auto-setup doesn't work perfectly:

1. **Assign References** in CustomSetup inspector:
   - Drag your **Result Panel** to `resultPanel`
   - Drag your **Correct Result** image to `correctResultImage`
   - Drag your **wrong Result** image to `wrongResultImage`

2. **Check Setup**:
   - Right-click CustomSetup component → "Check Setup"
   - Look for any missing references

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**❌ "Result images not showing"**
- Make sure your "Correct Result" and "wrong Result" GameObjects are assigned
- Check that they're children of your Result Panel

**❌ "Submit button not working"**
- Verify AnswerVerifier script is enabled
- Check that PlayerController reference is assigned

**❌ "Equation not updating"**
- Check that PlayerController.currentNumber is being updated
- Verify equationText reference is assigned

## 🎨 **Customization**

### **Change Result Display:**
Your existing result images will be used automatically. The system will:
- Show "Correct Result" image for correct answers
- Show "wrong Result" image for wrong answers
- Hide both when starting new round

### **Change Equation Type:**
Edit `GenerateNewEquation()` in `AnswerVerifier.cs`:
```csharp
// For subtraction
firstNumber = Random.Range(5, 15);
secondNumber = Random.Range(1, firstNumber);
correctAnswer = firstNumber - secondNumber;
```

## 🎮 **Input Methods**

- **Mouse**: Click Submit button
- **Keyboard**: Space or Enter to submit
- **Movement**: Arrow keys (Left/Right) or your existing input

## ✅ **Features**

- ✅ **Uses your existing UI structure**
- ✅ **Works with your result images**
- ✅ **Real-time equation display**
- ✅ **Dynamic answer verification**
- ✅ **Multiple input methods**
